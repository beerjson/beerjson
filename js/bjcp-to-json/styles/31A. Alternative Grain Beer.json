  "category_description": "This category contains Specialty-TypeBeers usingeither grain or sugar to add a distinctive character. See the Introduction to Specialty-Type Beer section for additional comments, particularly on evaluating the balance of added ingredients to the base beer.",
  "notes": "An Alternative Grain Beer is a standard beer (Classic Style or not) with additional or non-standard brewing grains (e.g., rye, oats, buckwheat, spelt, millet, sorghum, rice) added or used exclusively. Gluten-free (GF) beers made from completely gluten-free ingredients may be entered here, while GF beers using process-based gluten removal should be entered in their respective base style categories.",
  "overall_impression": "A tasteful integration of sugar and beer, but still recognizable as beer. The sugar character should both be evident and in balance with the beer, not so forward as to suggest an artificial product.",
  "aroma": "Same as the base beer, except that some additional fermentables (e.g., honey, molasses) may add an aroma, which should be a pleasant, balanced combination with the beer.",
  "appearance": "Same as the base beer, although some sugars will bring additional, usually darker, colors.",
  "flavor": "Same as the base beer, except that some additional fermentables (e.g., honey, molasses) may add a flavor, which should be a pleasant, balanced combination with the beer. Added sugars should not have a raw, unfermented flavor. Some unfermentable sugars provide a fuller finish, while fully fermentable sugars can thin out the finish.",
  "mouthfeel": "Same as the base beer, although depending on the type of sugar added, could increase or decrease the body.",
  "comments": "The additional sugar should be apparent somewhere in the sensory profile. If the sugars do not add a distinguishable character to the beer, enter it in the base style category. A honey-based beer should not have so much honey that it is perceived more like a mead with beer (i.e., a braggot) than a honey beer. This style should not be used for styles where the alternative sugar is fundamental to the style definition, or where a small amount of neutral-flavored sugar is used simply to increase gravity, increase attenuation, or lighten flavor or body; those beers should be entered as the normal base style.",
  "entry_instructions": "The entrant must specify the type of sugar used. Entrant must specify a description of the beer, identifying either a Base Style or the ingredients, specs, or target character of the beer. A general description of the special nature of the beer can cover all the required items.",
  "vital_statistics": "OG, FG, IBUs, SRM, and ABV will vary depending on the underlying base beer.",
