  "category_description": "While there are many Specialty-Type Beers in these guidelines, the Specialty Beer style category is intended for those beers that do not fit anywhere else. Please check each previous Specialty-Type category before entering a beer in one of these styles.34A. Commercial Specialty BeerThis style is intended for reproductions or interpretations of specific commercial beers that don’t fit withindefined styles. Beers entered here do not need to be exact copies. The beer should be judged as to how well it fits the broader style represented by the example beer, not how well it is an exact copy of a specific commercial product. If a Commercial Specialty Beerfitsanother defined style, do not enter it here.Overall Impression: Based on declared beer.Aroma: Based on declared beer.Appearance: Based on declared beer.Flavor: Based on declared beer.Mouthfeel: Based on declared beer.Comments: Intended as a catch-all location for specific beers that are based on unique commercial examples that don’t fit existing styles. Past versions of the Style Guidelines included a Belgian Specialty Ale style; this style fits that general purpose, as well as allowing non-Belgian entries of similar intent.Entry Instructions: The entrant must specify the name of the commercial beer, specifications (vital statistics) for the beer, and either a brief sensory description or a list of ingredients used in making the beer. Without this information, judges who are unfamiliar with the beer will have no basis for comparison.Vital Statistics: OG, FG, IBUs, SRM, and ABV will vary depending on the declared beer.Commercial Examples:Orval, La ChouffeTags: specialty-beer",
  "notes": "This style is intended for beers in Existing Styles (previously-defined Classic Style beers or Specialty-Type Beers) that are either:A combination of Existing Styles that are not defined previously in the guidelines, including combination of Specialty-Type Beers not otherwise allowable elsewhere.A variation of an Existing Style using a non-traditional method or process (e.g., dry-hopping, ‘eis’-ing, stein bier) for that style.A variation of an Existing Style using a non-traditional ingredient (e.g., yeast with a non-traditional profile, hops with a different character than described in the Base Style).Out-of-spec variations of an Existing Style (e.g., ‘imperial’ versions, ‘session’ versions, overly-sweet versions, etc.).This style is intended for beers that can’t be entered in previously-listed styles first, including (and especially) the declared Base Style of beer. However, if the unusual method, process, or ingredient results in a beer that now fits within another defined style, the beer should be entered there. Note that some styles already allow for different strengths (e.g., IPAs, Saisons), so those variations should be entered as the appropriate Base Style.Bear in mind that a poorly-made, faulted beer should not be used to define a new style. Drinkability should always be maintained, while allowing for creative new concepts.",
