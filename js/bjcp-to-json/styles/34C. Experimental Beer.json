No beer is ever “out of style” in this style, unless it can be entered in another beer stylefirst. This is the last resort for any beer entered into a competition. With the broad definition for previous styles, this style should be rarely used.",

  "entry_instructions": "The entrant must specify the special nature of the experimental beer, including the special ingredients or processes that make it not fit elsewhere in the guidelines. The entrant must provide vital statistics for the beer, and either a brief sensory description or a list of ingredients used in making the beer. Without this information, judges will have no basis for evaluation.",
