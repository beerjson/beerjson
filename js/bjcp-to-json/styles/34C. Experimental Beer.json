  "category_description": "While there are many Specialty-Type Beers in these guidelines, the Specialty Beer style category is intended for those beers that do not fit anywhere else. Please check each previous Specialty-Type category before entering a beer in one of these styles.34A. Commercial Specialty BeerThis style is intended for reproductions or interpretations of specific commercial beers that don’t fit withindefined styles. Beers entered here do not need to be exact copies. The beer should be judged as to how well it fits the broader style represented by the example beer, not how well it is an exact copy of a specific commercial product. If a Commercial Specialty Beerfitsanother defined style, do not enter it here.Overall Impression: Based on declared beer.Aroma: Based on declared beer.Appearance: Based on declared beer.Flavor: Based on declared beer.Mouthfeel: Based on declared beer.Comments: Intended as a catch-all location for specific beers that are based on unique commercial examples that don’t fit existing styles. Past versions of the Style Guidelines included a Belgian Specialty Ale style; this style fits that general purpose, as well as allowing non-Belgian entries of similar intent.Entry Instructions: The entrant must specify the name of the commercial beer, specifications (vital statistics) for the beer, and either a brief sensory description or a list of ingredients used in making the beer. Without this information, judges who are unfamiliar with the beer will have no basis for comparison.Vital Statistics: OG, FG, IBUs, SRM, and ABV will vary depending on the declared beer.Commercial Examples:Orval, La ChouffeTags: specialty-beer",
  "notes": "This is explicitly a catch-all category for any beer that does not fit into an Existing Style description. No beer is ever “out of style” in this style, unless it can be entered in another beer stylefirst. This is the last resort for any beer entered into a competition. With the broad definition for previous styles, this style should be rarely used.",
